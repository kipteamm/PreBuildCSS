# How to get started
Getting started with our CSS and JS library is luckily really easy.  
As easy as just adding two lines to your `<head>` tag.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

	<title></title>

    <!-- Styling and CSS -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://prebuildcss.kipteam.repl.co/static/css/styles.css">

    <!-- Javascript -->
	<script src="https://prebuildcss.kipteam.repl.co/static/js/script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
This is just an example file. We added the following two tags:
```html
<!-- Styling and CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://prebuildcss.kipteam.repl.co/static/css/styles.css">

<!-- Javascript -->
<script src="https://prebuildcss.kipteam.repl.co/static/js/script.js"></script>
```
Allowing you to make use of our library.
